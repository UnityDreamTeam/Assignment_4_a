# Assignment 4_a
This week we've been ask to improve a given game which can be found in this repasetory.
In this game we're playing a spacecraft who destroys its enemies during its spaces tavels.
In the oiginal version the spaceship can shot lasers towards emeny ships. The lasers destory the enemies and the enemies
destory our spaceship when collision occur.

We've added an extra tryouts , which means that we need to touch 3 emenies in order to be disqualified.
This extent to duration of the game and makes it a bit less frustrating. Also , we have added a special feature
which is a floating hearts which gives you a tryout ( In the game we describe it as "life"). You can reach to
3 lifes top.
